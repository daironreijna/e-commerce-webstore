# DAAK! Smart Shopper: E-Commerce Webstore
Welcome to DAAK! Smart Shopper. The e-commerce webstore you can trust!

Our shopping webpage has been created to offer customers the best choice products at unbeatable price and quality. 

## Overview

Welcome to our e-commerce webstore DAAK! The smart shopping interactive front-end application.

The DAAK! project team have used the skills and knowledge acquired during the bootcamp to build this web application. Our team has conceived and executed a design of a MVP of our project.

DAAK! allows users to select a vast range of items including clothes and jewellery. User is also able to navigate via the nav bar to particular products of interest add items to the shopping cart and be able to understand total cost of items for purchase. The user also has a link to log in to the webpage. 

In this project several technologies are used to bring a feature rich and exciting web project to life! As a project team we thought about what would be a simple way to shop for your favourite products.

### User Story

As a user looking for a simplified and interactive shopping experience on one dedicated webpage,  I want to be able to browse and add these products to my shopping cart prior to placing an order. This will allow me to see my total amount to be spent as well as any additional shipping costs.
